# IOOP-Application
A place to get the latest version of the -- IOOP Assignment -- that we have done so far.

Develop the application on the branch corresponding to your role.
The "main" branch will store the APPROVED COMMITS ONLY.
Create a PULL REQUEST from your branch if you want your commits to be merged into main, meaning requesting your commits to be pulled/merged into main.
First, push your local branch commits to the corresponding remote branch, then create the pull request in here, GitHub, from the branch.
I will review it. If it's approved, I will pull/merge those commits into the main branch here.

After I have approved, I will delete the remote branch that corresponds to your role (where the pull request come from) and create a new one with the same name, so that your remote branch is on track with "main" again. But you need to recreate your local branch that tracks your new local branch also, to continue developing.
